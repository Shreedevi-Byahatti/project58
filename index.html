        <p class="para">Dancing will always remain a part of my life. It is a kind of sports that every generation enjoys. On every special occasion I feel like dancing. When I dance in the parties nobody can stop me from moving my feet fast in the rhythm of the music. Even if someone does that itâ€™s like applying efforts to stop a natural-disaster. Since childhood dancing is & has been my passion always. Dancing allows me to express my emotions. No matter where I am if music strikes my ears I feel like dancing.
